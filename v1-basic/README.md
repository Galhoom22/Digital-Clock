# 🕒 Simple Console Clock V1.0

## 📝 Description

This is a basic console-based digital clock application built with C++. The program prompts the user to set an initial time (hours, minutes, and seconds) and then starts ticking, updating the display every second.

## 🖥️ Compatibility Note

This program is designed specifically for the **Windows Operating System** because it uses the `Windows.h` library for the `Sleep()` function and `system("cls")` to clear the console screen. It will not compile or run on other operating systems like macOS or Linux without modification.

## ▶️ How to Run

1.  **Compiler:** You need a C++ compiler configured for Windows (e.g., MinGW-w64).
2.  **Compile:** Open your terminal or command prompt and compile the `.cpp` file using a command like:
    ```sh
    g++ your_file_name.cpp -o clock.exe
    ```
3.  **Execute:** Run the generated executable file (`clock.exe`).
4.  **Input:** The program will ask you to enter the starting hour, minute, and second.
